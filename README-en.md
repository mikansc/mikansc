### Hi there 👋

My name is Michael Nascimento - you can call me Mika - and I'm from 🇧🇷. Actually, I'm a musician trying to do something fun for hobby. Code seens to be the right choose! 

Feel free to contact me. I love to meet new people - and I'd love to train my english too. 😋

Currently I'm looking for my first programming job. And I ❤️ ReactJS 😍

Nowadays I'm working hard on my studies. I don't know yet how I can help the GitHub community, so I pass the most of my time training algorithms and doing some fictional app. And I'm on preparation to start my System Analysis & Dev graduation 😍 looking forward to start!

Wanna talk about code, music or my country? Would be nice to meet you!
